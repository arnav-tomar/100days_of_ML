Context: Where This Topic Fits\n","In **Feature Engineering**, we usually cover these stages:\n","\n","1. Feature Transformation  \n","   - Missing value handling  \n","   - Encoding categorical variables  \n","   - Scaling & normalization  \n","\n","2. Feature Construction  \n","   - Creating new features from existing ones  \n","\n","3. Feature Selection (later, after models)  \n","   - Removing irrelevant or redundant features  \n","\n","4. **Feature Extraction (current topic)** ✅  \n","   - Creating **new lower-dimensional features** from many existing features  \n","\n","Dimensionality Reduction is the **core concept behind feature extraction**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. What is a Feature?\n","In Machine Learning terminology:\n","\n","- **Each column = one feature**\n","- Dataset with `n` columns ⇒ `n-dimensional space`\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","| Age | Salary | Experience |\n","|----|--------|-----------|\n","\n","This is **3-dimensional data**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. What is Dimensionality?\n","**Dimensionality = number of features (columns)**\n","\n","- 2 features → 2D space  \n","- 3 features → 3D space  \n","- 1000 features → 1000D space (very hard to visualize and compute)\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. Curse of Dimensionality (Core Concept)\n","\n","### Definition\n","> As the number of features (dimensions) increases, the data becomes sparse and machine learning models start performing worse instead of better.\n","\n","This problem is called the **Curse of Dimensionality**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. Why More Features Are NOT Always Better\n","\n","### Common beginner mistake\n","> \"More features = more information = better model\"\n","\n","❌ Wrong.\n","\n","### What actually happens:\n","- Computational cost increases\n","- Distance-based models break\n","- Overfitting increases\n","- Model becomes unnecessarily complex\n","- Performance may **decrease**\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 6. Intuition with Example (Very Important)\n","\n","### Example 1: Simple Dataset\n","Suppose:\n","- You have **5 useful features**\n","- Model performance is optimal\n","\n","Now you add **20 random or useless features**:\n","\n","- These new features **do not change much**\n","- But model has to **process them anyway**\n","- Noise increases\n","- Decision boundaries become unstable\n","\n","✅ Result: Accuracy drops\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 7. Image / Pixel Example (Teacher’s Explanation Simplified)\n","\n","Consider **image classification (boys vs girls)**:\n","\n","- Image size = `100 × 100`\n","- Total pixels = `10,000`\n","- Each pixel = 1 feature\n","\n","So:\n","10,000 features per image\n","\n","\n","Problems:\n","- Not all pixels matter\n","- Many pixels carry duplicate or useless information\n","- Distance between images becomes meaningless\n","- Model struggles to generalize\n","\n","✅ Solution: Reduce dimensions.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 8. Distance Problem in High Dimension\n","\n","In high-dimensional space:\n","- Distance between nearest and farthest points becomes almost equal\n","- Models like **KNN, SVM, KMeans** perform badly\n","\n","This happens because:\n","- Space grows exponentially\n","- Data points become extremely sparse\n","\n","This is a **mathematical issue**, not a coding issue.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 9. Symptoms of Curse of Dimensionality\n","\n","- High training accuracy, low test accuracy\n","- Training becomes slow\n","- Memory usage increases\n","- Model overfits easily\n","- Distance-based intuition fails\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 10. Solution: Dimensionality Reduction\n","\n","### Definition\n","> Dimensionality Reduction is the process of reducing the number of features while preserving important information.\n","\n","Goal:\n","High dimensions → Low dimensions\n","Minimal information loss\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 11. Two Major Approaches\n","\n","### 1️⃣ Feature Selection\n","- Select existing features\n","- Drop unnecessary columns\n","- Performed **after model building**\n","- Example:\n","  - Removing low-importance features\n","\n","We will study this **later**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2️⃣ Feature Extraction ✅ (Current Topic)\n","- Create **new features**\n","- Combine information from old features\n","- Reduce dimensionality mathematically\n","\n","Example:\n","- 100 features → 10 new features\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 12. Why Feature Extraction is Powerful\n","- Removes noise\n","- Reduces redundancy\n","- Improves model speed\n","- Improves generalization\n","- Works well with high-dimensional data (images, text)\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 13. Popular Dimensionality Reduction Techniques\n","\n","| Technique | Type | Notes |\n","|--------|------|------|\n","| PCA | Linear | Most common |\n","| LDA | Supervised | Uses labels |\n","| SVD | Linear | Used in NLP |\n","| Autoencoders | Neural | Deep learning |\n","| t-SNE | Non-linear | Visualization |\n","| UMAP | Non-linear | Scalable |\n","\n","➡️ **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** is the most important and comes next.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 14. When Should You Apply Dimensionality Reduction?\n","\n","✅ Use when:\n","- Number of features is very large\n","- Features are correlated\n","- Dataset is sparse\n","- Training is slow\n","- Overfitting observed\n","\n","❌ Avoid when:\n","- Features are already small\n","- Interpretability is critical (PCA reduces explainability)\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 15.
