Why Classification Metrics?\n","\n","After training a **classification model** (e.g. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree), the most important question is:\n","\n","> **How good is the model?**\n","\n","In **regression**, we used metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, R².\n","\n","In **classification**, we use **classification metrics** to evaluate model performance.\n","\n","This document covers **Accuracy** and **Confusion Matrix** in full depth, with intuition, math, edge cases, and Python code.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2.
