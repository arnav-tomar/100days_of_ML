What is Out-of-Bag (OOB) Evaluation?\n","\n","**Out-of-Bag (OOB) evaluation** is an *internal validation technique* used in **Random Forest** and **Bagging-based algorithms**.\n","\n","It allows you to estimate model performance **without creating a separate validation or test set**.\n","\n","This works because Random Forest uses **bootstrap sampling (sampling with replacement)**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. Bootstrap Sampling Refresher\n","\n","Assume:\n","- Dataset size = $N$\n","- For each tree, we sample $N$ rows **with replacement**\n","\n","### What happens?\n","\n","- Some rows are selected **multiple times**\n","- Some rows are **never selected**\n","\n","Those never-selected rows are called:\n","\n","> **Out-of-Bag (OOB) samples**\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Why ~37% Data Becomes OOB (Mathematics)\n","\n","For a given data point $x_i$:\n","\n","Probability it is **not selected once**:\n","$$\n","1 - \\frac{1}{N}\n","$$\n","\n","Probability it is **never selected in $N$ draws**:\n","$$\n","\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{N}\\right)^N\n","$$\n","\n","As $N \\to \\infty$:\n","$$\n","\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{N}\\right)^N \\approx e^{-1} \\approx 0.368\n","$$\n","\n","### ✅ Result\n","$$\n","\\boxed{\\text{~36.8\\% of data is OOB for each tree}}\n","$$\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. How OOB Evaluation Works (Step-by-Step)\n","\n","1. Train Random Forest with bootstrap sampling\n","2. For each data point:\n","   - Identify trees **where this point was NOT used**\n","3. Predict using **only those trees**\n","4. Aggregate predictions:\n","   - Classification → majority vote\n","   - Regression → mean\n","5. Compare with true label\n","\n","This produces the **OOB score**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. Why OOB is Unbiased\n","\n","- OOB samples were **never seen** during training of those trees\n","- Equivalent to testing on unseen data\n","- Statistically similar to cross-validation\n","- No data leakage\n","\n","> OOB is a *free validation set* built into Random Forest.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 6. When Should You Use OOB?\n","\n","### ✅ Best Use Cases\n","- Small datasets\n","- When you want quick validation\n","- Hyperparameter tuning\n","- Interview explanations\n","\n","### ❌ Not Ideal When\n","- Very few trees ($n\\_estimators < 50$)\n","- Bootstrap is disabled\n","- Extremely imbalanced datasets (use carefully)\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 7. Required Hyperparameters for OOB\n","\n","To enable OOB in scikit-learn:\n","\n","```python\n","RandomForestClassifier(\n","    n_estimators=200,\n","    bootstrap=True,\n","    oob_score=True,\n","    random_state=42\n",")\n","```\n","\n","### Mandatory Conditions\n","- `bootstrap=True`\n","- `oob_score=True`\n","- Sufficient number of trees\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 8. Practical Code Example (Classification)\n","\n","```python\n","from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","\n","# Load data\n","X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)\n","\n","# Train-test split (optional, only for comparison)\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n","    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42\n",")\n","\n","# Random Forest with OOB\n","rf = RandomForestClassifier(\n","    n_estimators=200,\n","    bootstrap=True,\n","    oob_score=True,\n","    random_state=42\n",")\n","\n","rf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","print(\"OOB Score:\", rf.oob_score_)\n","print(\"Test Accuracy:\", rf.score(X_test, y_test))\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 9. OOB for Regression\n","\n","For regression, OOB computes **$R^2$ score**:\n","\n","```python\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n","\n","rf = RandomForestRegressor(\n","    n_estimators=300,\n","    bootstrap=True,\n","    oob_score=True,\n","    random_state=42\n",")\n","\n","rf.fit(X, y)\n","print(\"OOB R^2:\", rf.oob_score_)\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 10. OOB vs Train-Test Split\n","\n","| Aspect | OOB | Train-Test Split |\n","|------|----|------------------|\n","| Extra data split | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |\n","| Data efficiency | High | Lower |\n","| Bias | Low | Depends |\n","| Speed | Fast | Medium |\n","| CV-like | Yes | No |\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 11. OOB vs Cross-Validation\n","\n","- OOB ≈ Leave-one-out behavior\n","- Faster than k-fold CV\n","- Slightly higher variance than CV\n","- Excellent for Random Forest only\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 12. Interview-Ready Explanation\n","\n","> Random Forest uses bootstrap sampling, so around 37% of samples are not used in training each tree. These Out-of-Bag samples act as unseen data. By aggregating predictions from trees where a sample was OOB, we get an unbiased estimate of model performance without a validation set.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 13. Common Mistakes\n","\n","- Using `oob_score=True` with `bootstrap=False`\n","- Too few trees\n","- Comparing OOB directly with training accuracy\n","- Assuming OOB replaces final test set\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 14. Key Takeaways\n","\n","- OOB is **free validation**\n","- ~37% data is OOB per tree\n","- Works only with bootstrap-based models\n","- Highly interview-relevant\n","- Great for fast tuning\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 15. Final Advice\n","\n","> Use OOB during **model development**.  \n","> Still keep a **final test set** for reporting results.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"DWjpg2F8pstg"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"V3voM7vAncdb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768312515341,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3488,"user":{"displayName":"Arnav
