        "* **What it does:** rotates the coordinate axes to new directions that capture the largest variance; you can keep the top K components to reduce dimensionality.\n",
        "* **Why variance matters:** directions with high variance contain more information (differences between data points). PCA keeps those and discards low‑variance directions likely to be noise or redundancy.\n",
        "* **Where to use it:** when you need faster models, lower memory, visualization, or to reduce overfitting from very high-dimensional numeric data.\n",
        "* **How to use it correctly:**\n",

        "  * Always split data first (train/test).\n",
        "  * Fit PCA only on training data.\n",
        "  * Scale features before PCA.\n",
        "  * Put PCA inside the training `Pipeline` used for cross‑validation to avoid leakage.\n",
        "* **Limitations:** linear method (won't capture nonlinear manifolds), unsupervised (ignores labels), may harm classification if discriminative signal lies in low-variance directions.\n",
