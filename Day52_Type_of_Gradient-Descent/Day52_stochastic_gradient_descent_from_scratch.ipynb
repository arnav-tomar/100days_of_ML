Problem with Batch Gradient Descent (Why SGD Is Needed)\n","\n","Recall Batch Gradient Descent.\n","\n","To update parameters, we calculate derivatives of the loss function with respect to **each parameter**, using **the entire dataset**.\n","\n","For example, for multiple linear regression:\n","\n","$\n","y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p x_p\n","$\n","\n","Loss function:\n","\n","$\n","L = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n","$\n","\n","For every parameter $\\beta_j$, we compute:\n","\n","$\n","\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\beta_j}\n","$\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2.1 Computational Explosion\n","\n","Assume:\n","- Number of rows = $n$\n","- Number of features = $p$\n","- Total parameters = $p + 1$\n","\n","For **one iteration**:\n","- Each derivative involves summation over $n$ rows\n","- Total derivatives per iteration = $p + 1$\n","\n","So operations scale roughly as:\n","\n","$\n","O(n \\times p)\n","$\n","\n","If:\n","- $n = 100{,}000$ rows  \n","- $p = 100$ features  \n","\n","Then per iteration, you are computing **millions of operations**.\n","\n","This makes Batch Gradient Descent:\n","- Extremely slow\n","- Memory intensive\n","- Impractical for large datasets\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Vectorization Helps, But Creates Another Problem\n","\n","We often use **vectorization** to speed things up.\n","\n","Prediction:\n","\n","$$\n","\\hat{y} = X\\beta\n","$$\n","\n","Gradient:\n","\n","$$\n","\\nabla L = -2 X^T (y - X\\beta)\n","$$\n","\n","This removes explicit loops.\n","\n","### But the problem is:\n","\n","To do this, you must:\n","- Load **entire dataset** into RAM\n","- Store $X$ and $y$ fully in memory\n","\n","If dataset is huge (GBs):\n","- RAM overflows\n","- Program crashes\n","- Hardware becomes a bottleneck\n","\n","So even vectorization does **not solve the scalability issue**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4.
