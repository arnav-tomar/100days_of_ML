Introduction\n","Till now, we have covered:\n","1. **Batch Gradient Descent** – the most basic version\n","2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**\n","$$\n","\\textbf{Mini-Batch Gradient Descent}\n","$$\n","\n","This method is extremely important because **it is the most commonly used gradient descent variant in practice**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. Core Idea: What Actually Changes?\n","\n","All gradient descent variants differ in **only one thing**:\n","\n","> **How frequently parameters are updated**\n","\n","Mathematics remains the same.\n","\n","Only **how much data is used per update** changes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. Recap: Batch vs Stochastic\n","\n","### Batch Gradient Descent\n","\n","- Uses **entire dataset**\n","- Updates parameters **once per iteration**\n","\n","If dataset has $n$ rows:\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Updates per epoch} = 1\n","$$\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n","\n","- Uses **one data point**\n","- Updates parameters after **every row**\n","\n","If dataset has $n$ rows:\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Updates per epoch} = n\n","$$\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Problems So Far\n","\n","- **Batch GD** → slow, memory-heavy, stable\n","- **SGD** → fast, noisy, unstable near minimum\n","\n","So we need something **in between**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. What is Mini-Batch Gradient Descent?\n","\n","Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is a **hybrid approach**.\n","\n","Instead of:\n","- Using all rows (Batch)\n","- Using one row (SGD)\n","\n","We use a **small group of rows**, called a **mini-batch**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. Mini-Batch Concept\n","\n","Let:\n","- Total rows = $n$\n","- Batch size = $b$\n","\n","Then number of batches:\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Number of batches} = \\frac{n}{b}\n","$$\n","\n","Each batch produces **one parameter update**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 6.
